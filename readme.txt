TeamPress is project management & collaboration software, made the WordPress way.

== Description ==

I got bored looking for the perfect project management tool. Project Pier was the closest I found but is unfortunatly 
not being maintained regularly. Redmine would be nice if it worked on my shared hosting and could be integrated well in
my WordPress site. BaseCamp is cool, but not available self-hosted and pretty expensive. That's how TeamPress is born.

TeamPress builds on WordPress' user management and custom post types to offer project management & collaboration tools
to anybody who's been looking for it.

== Installation ==

1. Place the 'teampress' folder in your '/wp-content/plugins/' directory.
